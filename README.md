REST API for GRT [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tuzhucheng/REST-API-for-GRT.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tuzhucheng/REST-API-for-GRT)
================

This is an open source REST API for Grand River Transit (GRT), which serves the Kitchener, Waterloo, and Cambridge regions. You can use this API to obtain the next bus times, future bus times, buses that stop at a particular stop, and much more. It is currently a work in progress so not all of the functionalities are implemented and the API may change rapidly.

Data is generously provided by GRT via the Region of Waterloo's Open Data Portal, using the Google Transit Feed Specifications (GTFS) format.

Documentation for this API is coming soon.
